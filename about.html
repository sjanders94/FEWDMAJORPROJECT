<h1>About Us</h1>
<div id="about">


<p> Anderson's Theatre was built in 1995
    to bring year-round movie entertainment to residents
    of Mount Sterling and neighboring communities. 
   Anderson's Theatre is located in the heart of downtown 
    Mount Sterling

    We offer 6 movie screen areas that can hold up to 
    75 people. We frequently add new movies to our location
    to give our customers options to view new movies 
    out on the market.

    <br>

   Let  Anderson's host your next birthday party
   or family night! A bowling alley and arcade are
    located inside the same building as the theatre so 
   that a fun, safe time can be accessed in one location!
